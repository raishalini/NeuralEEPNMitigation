# Investigation of Neural Equalization Enhanced Phase Noise Mitigation
This thesis explores the challenges of using Neural Networks (NN) for Equalization-Enhanced Phase Noise (EEPN) mitigation in communication systems, specifically focusing on the pitfalls associated with low Achievable Information Rate (AIR) and model generalization. The primary issue addressed is the phenomenon of the ‘jail window‘, which occurs when a neural network fails to generalize across different operating conditions, such as varying linewidths and link distances. This problem is exacerbated by the use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a loss function, which tends to overemphasize large errors and can lead the model to memorize noise patterns rather than learn underlying signal characteristics. The thesis investigates the impact of MSE on the formation of ‘jail window‘, supported by existing literature on its role in signal processing tasks. Through this exploration, the thesis aims to provide insights into the limitations of neural networks in communication systems, offering suggestions for improving model robustness and generalization. Ultimately, the work shifts the focus from EEPN mitigation to a broader discussion on the inherent challenges and potential solutions when applying neural networks to complex signal processing problems.
